# Analyzing-Churn-Rate-for-Databel

## Overview
This Power BI project analyzes customer churn data from a fictional telecommunications company, Databel. The goal was to visualize the company's churn rate and uncover key drivers behind customer attrition. Using clear dashboards and interactive visuals, I identified trends related to factors such as contract type, tenure, and monthly charges. The insights gained helped inform practical recommendations for reducing churn and improving customer loyalty.


## Objectives
1. Visualize the overall customer churn rate to provide a high-level understanding of attrition within the company.

2. Identify key drivers of customer churn, such as contract type, tenure, and monthly charges, using data exploration techniques.

3. Build interactive and insightful Power BI dashboards to make the data easily accessible and interpretable for decision-makers.

4. Generate actionable recommendations based on data insights to help the company reduce churn and improve customer retention.


## Tools & Technologies

* **Power BI** – Used to build interactive dashboards and visualizations for monitoring churn trends and uncovering customer behavior patterns.

* **Power Query** – Handled data cleaning, transformation, and shaping to prepare the dataset for analysis.

* **DAX (Data Analysis Expressions)** – Created calculated columns and measures to compute the churn rate, highlight key drivers, and segment customers for deeper insights.



## Insights and Visuals

## Insights

* **The overall churn rate was 26.86% out of over 6,500 customers**, which means about 1 in 4 customers discontinued their services. This is a strong indicator that customer retention is a serious issue and should be a priority for the company moving forward to protect recurring revenue and maintain customer loyalty.

* **A large portion of churned customers left due to competitor advantages**, including better devices, more data, higher download speeds, and more attractive offers. This suggests that Databel needs to improve its service offerings or pricing structure in order to stay competitive in the market and retain customer interest.

* **California recorded the highest churn rate at 63.24%**, significantly higher than other states. This highlights the need for a deeper investigation into region-specific challenges — such as local competitor dominance, service quality issues, or poor customer satisfaction — so that tailored retention strategies can be developed for this region.

* **The age group with the highest churn rate was customers aged 80 and above**, showing that older customers may be struggling with usability, experiencing service dissatisfaction, or not seeing the value in the current offerings. This insight points to a need for better customer support, simplified communication, and more accessible service options for senior users.

* **A total of 6,123 service calls were made, with an average of 0.92 calls per customer**, indicating that customers often had to reach out for assistance. This suggests underlying service quality or satisfaction issues that, if unresolved, may lead to frustration and ultimately churn. Enhancing support efficiency and proactively addressing common problems could significantly reduce these numbers.

* **Customers on monthly subscription contracts had the highest churn rate at 46.29%**, in contrast to those with longer-term yearly contracts. The flexibility of monthly plans may be encouraging short-term commitment and easy switching. Introducing loyalty incentives or benefits for long-term subscriptions may help reduce this churn.

* **Those using paper checks as their payment method churned more frequently than those who used credit or debit cards.**  This may reflect less engagement or more friction in the payment process, and suggests that encouraging customers to switch to digital payment methods could improve convenience and reduce the likelihood of churn.

## Recommendations

* **Revamp service plans to compete effectively**: Since many customers are leaving for better offers, devices, and speeds from competitors, Databel should review and enhance its pricing packages, data plans, and device bundles to stay competitive and attractive.

* **Launch a targeted retention campaign in California**: With California having the highest churn rate (63.24%), it’s essential to investigate local issues and deploy a region-specific customer loyalty program, possibly including discounts, better service guarantees, or dedicated support lines.

* **Improve experience for senior customers (≥80 years)**: The high churn rate in this age group calls for simplified user interfaces, senior-friendly support, and tailored communication strategies to make services more accessible and intuitive.

* **Optimize customer service operations**: With over 6,000 service calls and nearly 1 call per customer, Databel should invest in improving first-contact resolution, self-service tools (e.g., chatbots or FAQs), and faster escalation processes to reduce friction and frustration.

* **Incentivize long-term contracts over monthly plans**: The 46.29% churn rate among monthly subscribers suggests a need for better retention hooks. Offering discounted rates, loyalty rewards, or bundled perks for long-term plans can encourage commitment and reduce churn.

* **Promote digital payment methods**: Customers using paper checks churn more often, possibly due to outdated or inconvenient payment processes. Databel should promote seamless digital payment options and possibly phase out paper billing to enhance user experience.
